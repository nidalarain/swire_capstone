# Swire Coca-Cola Logistics Optimization Project
##  Project Overview
This project was conducted in collaboration with Swire Coca-Cola as part of the MSBA Capstone at the University of Utah. The goal was to optimize delivery operations by identifying which customers could be transitioned from Swire’s proprietary red truck fleet to third-party white truck delivery — without compromising future growth potential or customer satisfaction.

## Business Problem
Swire faces high delivery costs serving low-volume customers with its own fleet. While transitioning these customers to white truck (third-party) delivery could save costs, it also risks alienating customers with future growth potential. The challenge was to segment customers in a way that balances cost-efficiency with long-term value.

## Our Approach

### Business Understanding
- Defined core objective: reduce logistics costs without sacrificing high-potential customers.
- Outlined customer types: local market partners, high-frequency buyers, and emerging accounts.

### EDA & Feature Engineering
- Created behavioral features using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** framework.
- Enriched customer profiles using **public census data** (e.g., income, population).
- Visualized volume trends and delivery cost patterns by segment and region.

### Modeling & Segmentation
- Applied **PCA + K-Means clustering** to segment customers into meaningful profiles.
- Built a **Random Forest model** to validate clusters and extract feature importance.
- Developed an **ARIMA model** to forecast volume growth by Cold Drink Channel.
- Created a **Growth Potential Score** based on economic, volume, and frequency signals.

### Fleet Assignment Logic
Developed decision rules based on cluster, volume, and growth attributes:
- High-volume customers (>1,349 gallons/year) assigned to **Red Trucks**
- Low-demand customers and Cluster 3 assigned to **White Trucks**
- Cluster 2 split based on growth indicators and frequency

## Business Value

**Cost Efficiency:** Confidently reroute true low-volume customers to reduce delivery expenses.  
 **Customer Retention:** Preserve high-touch service for promising accounts with strong growth signals.  
 **Scalable Framework:** Fleet assignments now follow clear business rules and scoring logic — ready to scale across markets.  
 **Strategic Insights:** Provided a deeper understanding of customer profiles based on behavioral and economic patterns.
